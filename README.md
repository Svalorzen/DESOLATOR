#DESOLATOR
##DEcentralized SOLutions And Tactics Of RTS

Project Intelligent Systems Track, MSc AI 2013.

In this project we try to extend the approach of C. Jackson and K. Bogert. They implemented an application of a Dec-POMDP in a real-time strategy game (Starcraft) using Joint Equilibrium-based Search for Policy (JESP) algorithm. We propose to extend this application by applying the same algorithm for heterogeneous teams.
